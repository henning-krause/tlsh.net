# TLSH - Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hash

TLSH is a fuzzy matching library.
Given a byte stream with a minimum length of 50 bytes
TLSH generates a hash value which can be used for similarity comparisons.
Similar objects will have similar hash values which allows for
the detection of similar objects by comparing their hash values.  Note that
the byte stream should have a sufficient amount of complexity.  For example,
a byte stream of identical bytes will not generate a hash value.

This is a .NET implementation of the hashing algorithm. Currently this is optimized for .Net 4.8. Better support for .Net > 8.0 will come later.
